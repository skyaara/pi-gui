# Folders and threads

Users switch folders and conversations in the sidebar and recover the selected thread and unfinished draft after reopening the app.

## Sub-features

- `navigation-sidebar`: select threads across folders.
- `navigation-recency`: The sidebar shows Pinned, Projects, then Recents. Customize Sidebar offers Recents (default) or Projects grouping. Recents combines chats of all ages across folders, five threads then Show more, while keeping project folders visible. Projects nests threads under each folder and keeps non-project chats in Recents. Rows show a single title with project context on hover and no date. Send bumps recency; open/focus/viewed do not. ⌘1…⌘9 follow visible rows, pinned first. Holding Command (Ctrl on Windows and Linux) paints shortcut badges; release hides them.
- `navigation-restart`: preserve selected folder, thread, and composer draft.
- `navigation-new-thread`: open the new-thread composer.
- `navigation-pinning`: pin/unpin, reorder pinned threads, and preserve pin state across restart.
- `navigation-pinning-running`: pin/unpin immediately while a composer prompt is still running.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Select a folder/thread in the sidebar.
- Send in a thread and confirm it moves to the top of Recents. Opening it must leave the order unchanged. ⌘1 stays the first pinned thread, or the first visible chat when nothing is pinned.
- Hover a thread and click Pin; click its Unpin icon in the Pinned section.
- Click New thread in the sidebar or press Cmd+N (Control+N elsewhere; File > New Thread). A folder row also has a "+" (`New thread in <folder>`) that opens New thread for that folder; project folder rows remain visible in both grouping modes. A fast double Enter starts only one thread. Shift+Cmd+O still works as an alias. Shift+Cmd+N opens a new window instead.
- Open the one thread-actions menu from the header Thread actions button or by right-clicking a row; Cmd-K lists the same actions. It offers Rename (Shift+Cmd+R, inline), Pin/Unpin, Archive (Shift+Cmd+A), Mark as read (only when the thread has unseen updates), Add/Edit scheduled task, Copy session ID.
- Cmd-K opens the command palette (Recents, Chats, Workspaces, Actions); Cmd-P opens the file palette; Ctrl-Tab opens the Recent threads switcher; Cmd+B toggles the sidebar. Drag the sidebar edge ("Sidebar width" separator, also arrow keys) to resize it; the width persists and double-click resets it.
- Open a folder through the sidebar Open folder button or Cmd+O on macOS (OS folder picker; no Control+O elsewhere); this is a separate native entry.

## Driving it with Playwright

Preconditions: isolated profile and two fixture folders for sidebar switching.

- **Switch/restart:** run `pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:runner -- apps/desktop/tests/core/navigation.spec.ts`. It selects Alpha/Beta sessions through the sidebar, asserts `.chat-header__title`, and checks `composer` draft and `.session-row--active` after restart.
- **New-thread entry:** run `pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:runner -- apps/desktop/tests/core/composer-controls.spec.ts`; it presses `desktopShortcut("N")` and `new-thread-composer` must become visible and focused.
- **Folder picker:** use `pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:prod:open-folder-real` for the actual native dialog; reserve foreground input. Core `initialWorkspaces` is fixture setup, not picker proof.
- **Visible maintenance:** `.agents/skills/verify-pi-gui/scripts/prove.sh --maintenance` starts threads with New thread and Start thread until the Recents list shows `Show more Recents`, then clicks Show less Recents. It also pins and unpins the active row while that run still reports running. It does not insert sessions through IPC.
- **Pinning:** run `pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:e2e:runner -- apps/desktop/tests/core/sidebar-ordering.spec.ts apps/desktop/tests/core/stop-running-prompt.spec.ts`. The first spec covers ordering, pin persistence after relaunch, unpinning and repinning. The second holds the real submit IPC open with a controlled driver, clicks Unpin and Pin, and requires each change while the row still reports running; Stop must still work afterward. This is fixture-backed Electron proof; `--maintenance` adds the live-provider pin/unpin.
- **Recency list:** run `pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop run test:core:sidebar-recency`. Checks Pinned → Projects → Recents, mixed-age chats in one list, five-row preview and Show more, project context on hover, no timestamps, last-send ordering, grouping persistence, and keyboard slots in visible order. The core spec seeds sessions through IPC; `--maintenance` covers the New thread path. `standalone-threads.spec.ts` also verifies non-project chats remain reachable in Projects grouping after restart.
- **Thread-actions menu, switcher, palette:** `thread-menu.spec.ts` (header and right-click menus, Shift+Cmd+R rename, Shift+Cmd+A archive), `thread-switcher.spec.ts`, `command-palette.spec.ts`, and `sidebar-toggle.spec.ts`, each via `test:e2e:runner`. No `prove.sh` lane drives these.
- **Folder "+" and resize:** `sidebar-layout.spec.ts` via `test:e2e:runner`. No `prove.sh` lane drives these.
- **Proof:** record the selected row, topbar title, draft before shutdown and after relaunch, with action traces. Cover sidebar and keyboard entries separately when claiming both.

## Gotchas

- `createNamedThread` uses IPC; this existing spec proves selection/draft behavior, not user-driven thread creation or provider execution.
- The recency spec also seeds sessions through IPC and older `catalogs.json` / `lastInteractedAt` timestamps; it proves list shape and shortcuts, not New thread.
- Injected transcript deltas establish renderer behavior only; real run proof belongs in live.
- Testing unpin only while idle or after restart misses action-queue blocking. Require the pin change before the active prompt completes. For live-provider confirmation, exercise the same controls during a real running follow-up and check that the run continues; the default conversation recipe does not currently include this checkpoint.
